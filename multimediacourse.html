               <p><strong>Artifact 1 E-Portfolio Website: This is what you are looking at.</strong> Description: Designing a website to showcase my e-portfolio was the focus for this course. I was a web designer before I became a teacher so this task was very familiar for me. I designed the look and the layout of the website and wrote the HTML using Dreamweaver. The website has 5 major sections that house my artifacts and pertinent information about them. I have incorporated audio, video and pictures to help explain my e-portfolio. 
Impact: I was a web designer in the middle to late 1990s. I was using HTML exclusively to design my pages. I started my teacher career in 2001 and did not keep current in my code writing skills. Designing my e-portfolio was exciting and I was ready to learn new ways of writing code for the web. I decided to learn more about Cascading Style Sheet and use that tool to design my pages. I was able to use CSS to clean up my HTML code and define my fonts, placement, and colors more easily. I feel comfortable now using CSS to design web pages.
Intent: Designing web pages for education is a must now that there is a focus for our students to use technology. There are several tools that help make that task easier. You can use Google Sites if you are school that uses Google Classroom. There are other companies who let you design small websites and host them for free or a small fee. I will continue to design educational web pages that are interactive and easy to use that will help my students. 
 </p>
                <p><strong>Artifact 2 Mini Projects to include in E-Portfolio:</strong> Description: These 6 mini projects were set up to help break down the task of designing an e-portfolio. Each mini project was one piece of the E-portfolio that I needed to design and include in the final website.
Impact: Learning how the proper way to add audio, video and pictures to a website was insightful. For example, it is not a good idea to have any media portion of a web page set to auto play when loaded. This is annoying for the user. It is much better to have the user decide when they want to hear a piece of audio or view a video. This control will help the user want to stay on your website. 
Intent: I have changed the way that I include video and audio on to my web pages for my students. They are now able to decide when to watch videos and they have the controls to pause and play each video that they chose to watch.

                <p><strong><a href="KreiderRockEd Description PaperWBLS.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 3 Web-based Learning System:</a></strong> Description: This was a group project. Our task was to design a web based learning system (WBLS) for content and age group of our choice. We decided to design a 5 week course to complement the Environment Science Ohio State Learning standards for High School. Our target audience is ages 17 and up. This web based learning system can also be used in a community setting to promote lessening your carban footprint and learning how to refuse, reduce, reuse, and recycle single use plastics. We followed that the design, implementation, and evaluation model as outlined by the book, "Web-Based Learning", by Gayle V. Davision-Shrivers and Karen L. Rasmussen. This WBLS was developed in 8 weeks, with expert and user reviews, evaluation, and redesign to complete the project.
                Impact: Our team learned the most about the design, content, and usability from our expterts who reviewed our web based learning system. The web design experts were very helpful in giving us suggestions on how to imporve our WBLS to make it more conhesive and easier to use. The content experts let us know that we needed to make sure that the user understood that our content was very general and that they could access other resources to dig deeper into each sub head of our WBLS. The user reviews were very helpful. They students who reviewed our WBLS gave us some insight in how the WBLS would be viewed and used in a classroom. They were very honest in how they would approach this information for a class. All of these reviews helped us to refine our WBLS to make it student centered and user friendly.
                Intent: Our team talked about our approach to future designs of web based learning systems. We all agreed that the expert reviews were the most helpful and we would schedule these reviews more often during our design and development stages of the WBLS. It is easier to redesign and fix problems before full implementation of the WBLS and redesigning small problems along the way is better for everyone because the process is still in a fluid phase and changes are to be expected and embraced.
