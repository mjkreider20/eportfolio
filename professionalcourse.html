                 <p><strong><a href="PreAdmission Competency.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 1 Pre-admission Compentencies Verification:</a></strong> Description: The Pre-admission Verification Document is a rubric with the ISTE Technology Standards & Performance Indicators for Educators (NETS-T) outlined. The exercise was to describe any artifacts that I used in the classroom before starting the Instruction Technology Masterâ€™s Program at the University of Akron. 
Impact: Filling out this document showed me that I had incorporated many technology components during my instruction time with my students. I found many items that I had designed while I was a teacher at a brick and mortar school as well as many artifacts I have designed working for an Ohio E-school. 
Intent: I am very committed to continuing to develop and design educational tools for my students to grow and develop using technology. I will actively look for new technological tools that my students can use in the classroom. I am planning to stay at this Ohio E-School for as long it is open and to keep growing by researching technology options for my students.

                 <p><strong><a href="Philosophyofeducation.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 2 Teaching with Technology Philosophy:</a></strong> Description: This is my philosophy of teaching using technology. I have changed my philosophy of teaching over the last 10 years. I continue to believe that students should be lifelong learners, but now I have to design lessons using technology. This will help them love learning new things so they keep growing as people. 
Impact: Rewriting my teaching philosophy made me think about how education has changed over the past 10 years. I am more mindful of the technology that I use in the classroom. It has to enhance the lesson in some way and needs to be an integral part of the learning process. I have learned to use the TPACK model to help me design meaningful lessons using technology.
Intent: I will continue to follow the TPACK method of designing lessons throughout the rest of my career. I will start with the math curriculum, add the technology and end with the pedagogy knowledge when designing lessons for math and science. I will start with the technology knowledge, add the pedagogy and finish with the content knowledge when designing lessons for language arts and history.
