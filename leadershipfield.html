				<img src="bear.jpg" alt="Bear" width="275" height="183"/><p><strong><a href="Unit 2 Lesson 9 Average rate of change (1).pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 1 Pre-Algebra Guided Notes</a> and <a href="Unit 2 Lesson 9- Rate of Change.pdf" target="_blank"> Pages from the SMART Notebook Presentation</a></strong> Description: I had an opportunity to collaborate with 2 other math teachers in my building to create a more interactive unit for 9th grade pre-algebra. We met several times to brainstorm ideas about using the SMART board in our classrooms for more interactive lessons. We decided to use SMART Notebook to integrate games and interactive whiteboard activities for the students to be more engaged.
Impact: We found that the students enjoyed the interactive games and activities but they were not writing down many notes from the lesson or any of the example problems. I decided to create guided notes for each lesson in the unit. There were two versions. One version was more of an outline with headings, words, and space to write down information and spaces to write examples. The other version had more sentences with blanks to fill in words and examples printed so that the students could just write the steps on how to solve the problems. This version was given to students who had learning disabilities. 
Intent: I have continued to use guided notes for my students with disabilities. They are more willing to take notes in the online classroom during live class lessons if they have some direction. This helps them to know what is important and gives them a visual record of what we covered in class. I share these with other math teachers on my team.

				<p><strong><a href="https://forms.gle/SovnStSjqNeGWyuC8" target="_blank">Artifact 2: Needs Assessment:</a></strong> Description: Google Surveys are used to ask students, parents, and other teachers, what they need to make the lesson more interactive. Teacher surveys are geared toward what type of activity they want to incorporate in their class. Student and parent surveys are more specific in that they ask if the family has, for example, a smartphone, a tablet, or know how to download an App. 
Impact: The answers to the surveys help me to plan what I will use, in conjunction, with my online lessons. There are times when I would like to use an APP and have the students learn the material in a different way.
Intent: I find that there are many parents who do not want their child using their smartphone for school. Many of my students are too young to have their own smartphone but they will have a tablet. These students are encouraged to use the APP and the newer technology for the activity for formative assessment. Some students have no extra devices or are not allowed to use their parentâ€™s devices. For these students, I have to design a different method of delivery for the activity or formative assessment.
