				<img src="bear.jpg" alt="Bear" width="275" height="183"/><p><strong><a href="Unit 2 Lesson 9 Average rate of change (1).pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 1 Pre-Algebra Guided Notes</a> and <a href="Unit 2 Lesson 9- Rate of Change.pdf" target="_blank"> Pages from the SMART Notebook Presentation</a></strong></p><p><b> Description:</b> I had an opportunity to collaborate with 2 other math teachers in my building to create a more interactive unit for 9th grade pre-algebra. My two colleagues were experts in the math content and they sought me out to help design SMART board activities to go with the lessons because they knew that I was very knowledgable in using SMART technology and writing curriculum. I was able to understand the concerns and needs that the teachers had with designing this unit. We met several times, in person and over the phone, to brainstorm ideas about using the SMART board in our classrooms for more interactive lessons. We decided to use SMART Notebook to integrate games and interactive whiteboard activities for the students to be more engaged. I designed activities that supplemented each lesson throughtout the unit. I would test them on my special needs students and report the findings back to the other two teachers. I would observer their students using the activities and then make changes to the activites as needed. We worked together to design a set of guided notes that the students would access using an iPad as thier mobile device resource. The guided notes were also made available in printed form for the students who were not comfortable using electronic versions of the guided notes. </p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> We found that the students enjoyed the interactive games and activities but they were not writing down many notes from the lesson or any of the example problems on the electronic version of the notes. We decided to provide printed guided notes for each lesson in the unit. There were two versions. One version was more of an outline with headings, words, and space to write down information and spaces to write examples. The other version had more sentences with blanks to fill in words and examples printed so that the students could just write the steps on how to solve the problems. This version was given to students who had learning disabilities. The teachers in the math team reviewed the results of how the guided notes and activities helped when assessing the students on the content that was covered by the electonic notes and the electronic activities that are inculded.We used the data gatherered during our TBT meetings each week to design future lessons. </p> 
<p><b>Intent:</b> I have continued and will continue to use guided notes and electornic activities using different resoures for my students with disabilities. Students are provided with the guided notes via email. The students are then required to fill out the notes as the lesson progresses. I have shared the guided notes with my other math teachers on my team in the online environment. The other teachers are able to edit the notes to meet the need of their students. The students have the option of printing the notes at home and filling them out using pencils or filling them out online and saving them each day as a Word document. The students are more willing to take notes in the online classroom during live class lessons if they have some direction. Most students are able to type in the Word document and use a tablet to write down examples in the notes. This helps them to know what is important and gives them a visual record of what we covered in class.

				<p><strong><a href="https://forms.gle/75n7UwoqFVN6NSZa6" target="_blank">Artifact 2: Needs Assessment:</a></strong> and <strong><a href="MJKleadershipLetter2019.pdf" target="_blank">Personal Account</a></strong> </p><p><b>Description:</b> This Google Survey was designed to see if my colleagues knew about KaHoot and would like to learn more about it. This program uses gaming techniques to help students review material that has already been presented to them. I had used it with my students and wanted to share the game with others. The data that is collected is very valuable to use when differentiating future lessons for my special needs students. This survey was asking if anyone would like to learn more about this software program.</p> <p>The personal account is from the teacher who I instructed on how to use KaHoot. Cheryl continued to use KaHoot as a supplement to her instruction after I had helped her discover KaHoot. She then went on to use my instruction to help other teachers use the KaHoot program in their classrooms.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> The results of the survey were used by me to see if there was any interest in learning more about this program. I had 4 people respond. Out of those 4, one wanted more training. Myself and the other teacher set up a time to have a conference. I answered her questions and walked her through the tasks that she wanted to accommplish for her classroom. I showed her how to set up the questions to match the level of knowledge of her students. I walked her though the process of running the KaHoot game and how the students use thier personal mobile device to answer the questions. She was able to use KaHoot in her class and shared the knowledge of how to use this program with other teachers in the school. </p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> The time I spent talking to this teacher was very valuable for both of us. I let her know that if there was any other techology questions she had she could come to me and I would do my best to answer her questions. There has been many times, since then, that she has called or emailed me to answer questions about her technology issues. My collegue shared the information I had given her about several other technology related tools with other teachers in the school for them to use. I will continue to look for other resources and use them in my classroom that uses technology and share them with my online colleagues.
