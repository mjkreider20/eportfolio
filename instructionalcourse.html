				<p><strong><a href="ID Final Project.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 1 Instructional Design Project:</a></strong> Description: This group project was done to solve an educational problem for a professor teaching a college level class. We used student data, information from the professor and class objectives to design this solution. The ADDIE process was very helpful when designing this solution. 
Impact: The ADDIE model is similar to the process of designing a publication or logo I used when I was a graphic designer. I was surprised at the parallels. Talking with the client, assessing the need, target audience, and choosing a medium to use are the same things to consider when designing instruction using technology. 
Intent: I will do a needs assessment using Google Surveys to gather information from students, parents and teacher to make decision on what to use and what would work best for the lessons I need to design.

				<p><strong><a href="KreiderDesignDocument.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 2 Design Document:</a></strong> Description: This design document was a map for the design of my e-portfolio website. This is the first step in mapping out the content of a Website. The pages and content are decided. A basic color scheme, font family and layout are also decided here. 
Impact: This is very similar to making storyboards when working in graphic design and web design. The design document helps you start planning your project. It is a way to help make decisions on what you will include in your project.
Intent: I will always do some sort of plan like this when designing a web site. It helps me start to visualize what will be included and helps me figure the hierarchy of the information. I use the same process when designing lessons using technology.

                <p><strong><a href="Kreider OLE Simplifying Linear Expressions.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 3 Online Learning Project:</a></strong> Description: This is a website that was created for 7th grade special needs students. It has been used for intervention and remediation. I used the ADDIE model when designing this.
Impact: I used student test data to make decisions on what to include in this intervention website. Then I did an informal survey asking the students about learning preferences. I then added different forms of instruction and formative assessment.   
Intent: Designing lessons and educational websites using the models we learned in the instruction design class have helped me be more effective in creating lessons that incorporate technology. I will continue gathering needs and preferences from students and parents when designing lessons. Collaboration with other teachers will help the lessons to be more effective.
