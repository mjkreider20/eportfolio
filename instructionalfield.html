				<img src="tent.jpg" alt="tent" width="282" height="164"/> <p><strong><a href="https://forms.gle/LzFiSN5yxhsDw2ccA" target="_blank">Artifact 1 Student Needs Assessment:</a></strong></p><p><b>Description:</b> The needs assessment here are designed to gather data and information about what the students and parents have available to use for education. The results of the surveys will be used to make decisions on what technology to use the best way for delivery of lessons and assessments.</p> 
<p><b>Impact:</b> I found that there were only a few students who had access to a smartphone or tablet. This limited my ability to design lessons using Apps. I had to keep in mind that not all students were able to access some of the technology I wanted to use.</p> 
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will continue to use a needs or pre-assessment survey to help make decisions on what technology would be beneficial for my students. I will continue designing lessons and assessments in different formats to accommodate all learners.

                 <p><strong><a href="Digital Citizenship.pptx" target="_blank">Artifact 2 Student Digital Citizenship Information Presentation:</a></strong>(Click to download presentation)</p><p><b>Description:</b> I designed this presentation to explain what a good digital citizen is in the 21st century. I sent it to all of my students in an email and posted it on my announcements on my home page in my online environment. I also went over the pesentation in class on the first day.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> I went over the concepts, during the first few days of the new school year, so the students knew what was expected of them, discern information and give credit to information on the Internet.</p> 
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will continue doing this at the beginning of the school year. I think that I will include this in the “new student” packet I send out to new students during the year. I need to revisit these concepts during the times when we are doing writing assignments and research projects in language arts and science.

                 <p><strong><a href="https://forms.gle/8mFMKc8gMm9af1FUA" target="_blank">Artifact 3 Metaverse APP Post Assessment:</a></strong></p><p><b> Description:</b> This post assessment was designed to gather student data after they participated in t<b></b>he Metaverse experiences for the geometry unit. The questions asked if they used them, what they liked about the experiences, why they didn’t use them, and what could be improved.</p> 
<p><b>Impact:</b> The survey was sent to 16 students, 10 students responded. The respondents were from students who did and did not use the experiences. The information gather from this survey will be used to improve the experience in the future.</p> 
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will spend more time modeling how to use these experiences during class time. I will also explain how to install an APP to a hand held device and send or call parents to answer any questions they may have with this APP. I believe that my students, who are between the ages of 11 and 13, might not have their own hand held devices and the parents are still in control of the screen time they are allowed to have.
