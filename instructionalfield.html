				<img src="tent.jpg" alt="tent" width="282" height="164"/> <p><strong><a href="https://forms.gle/LzFiSN5yxhsDw2ccA" target="_blank">Artifact 1 Student Needs Assessment:</a></strong></p><p><b>Description:</b> The needs assessment here is designed to gather data and information about what mobile devices the students and parents have available to use for education. This survey is sent to the students in a welcome letter, as an email, at the beginning of school and to any new students who join our 100% online school after the year has begun. I post the Welcome letter on my home page in our online classroom environment. The results of the survey are used to make decisions on what technology to use and the best way for delivery of lessons and assessments. I have several activities that require the students download APPS to a mobile device. This information is vital to the success of these activities.</p> 
<p><b>Impact:</b>  I find that the majority of students in the 7th grade do not have their own cell phone. Some have access to some sort of table. Most students are relying on using their parent's cell phone for educational purposes. This limits my ability to design lessons using Apps. I have to keep in mind that not all students are able to access some of the technology I want to use. I try to keep my supplemental activites web based so all students are able to access them. If the majority of students have access to a mobile device, I will proceed with the activity that uses an APP and provide alternative materials to the students who do not. I will sometimes use the APP actitivy as extra credit and then have the student explain how the APP was used to further their understanding of the content. This helps the other students and parents understand how the APP is beneficial to the learning process. Some parents see that the activity is important to learning and will allow thier child to use their phone or tablet for the next assignment or activity.  </p> 
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will continue to use a needs or pre-assessment survey to help make decisions on what technology would be beneficial for my students. I will continue designing lessons and assessments in different formats to accommodate all learners. I will also show demostrations on how I will use the APPs and what the benefit will be to the student who uses the technology. This will help the parent and student understand the importance of using the technology that I find to supplement content in our curriculum. Thus, the parent and student might be more willing to download an APP and use it for the educational experience that I have intended.

                 <p><strong><a href="Digital Citizenship.pptx" target="_blank">Artifact 2 Student Digital Citizenship Information Presentation:</a></strong>(Click to download presentation)</p><p><b>Description:</b> I designed this presentation to explain what a good digital citizen is in the 21st century. I sent it to all of my students in an email and posted it on my announcements on my home page in my online environment. I also went over the pesentation in class on the first day.The activity at the end of the presentation is a pledge for them to sign to be a good digital citizen in the 21st century. Each student will get a copy of the last slide that they signed in an email so that they can have their name on our class Wall of Fame that is posted on my Home Page. </p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> This presentation is given to my students who are enrolled in the 100% online school where I teach. The presentation is loaded into Blackboard Collaborate before the class begins and the students log on at the appointed time to join the class. Our school as a very strict anti-bullying policy, plagerism policy, and sharing of personal information policy. I go over the concepts, during the first few days of the new school year, so the students know what is expected of them, discern information and give credit to information they use from the Internet. Many students did not know or cared about copyright laws. They use images and music from the internet to post on YouTube videos that they create without giving credit or asking permission for use. The students are told, constently, that they are not to copy and past information they find on the internet when writing a report without proper citations. They are not allowd to share any personal information with the written consent of their parent or gurardian and the other parent or gaurdain that they want to contact. All teachers in all subjects go over the same information during the beginning of the year so that the students understand that this information is very important. All of the policies are spelled out in our Student Handbook that each student receives when they enroll. </p> 
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will continue going over these policies and procedures at the beginning of the school year and remind the students of the policies during the year.  I include this presentation in the “new student” packet I send out to new students during the year in a Welcome email. I need revisit these concepts during the times when we are doing writing assignments and research projects in language arts and science to remind students about what plagerism is and how to avoid it.

                 <p><strong><a href="https://forms.gle/8mFMKc8gMm9af1FUA" target="_blank">Artifact 3 Metaverse APP Post Assessment:</a></strong></p><p><b> Description:</b> This post assessment was designed to gather student data after they participated in the Metaverse experiences for the geometry unit. I sent the survey link in an email to all of my special needs students. The Metaverse experiences use the Metaverse mobile APP that the students had to download to a mobile device. The QR codes were posted on my classroom home page where the students could access all 12 experiences. The experiences were made to take the place of a traditional assessment that would have been a multiple choice test over the content. The survey questions asked if they used the APP, what they liked about the experiences, why they didn’t use them, and what could be improved.</p> 
<p><b>Impact:</b> The survey was sent to 16 students, 10 students responded. The respondents were from students who did and did not use the experiences. The students who did not use the APP said that they did not have a cell phone or that their parent was not willing to let them use their phone to download any APP. The students who were not allowd or did not have access to a mobile device were given a choice of assessments: 1. a traditional assessment sent to them in thier email to fill out and return, or 2. take the multiple choice exam provided in the online curriculum. All 16 students completed an assessment for this unit. The information gathered from this survey was used to improve the experience in the future.</p> 
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will spend more time modeling how to use these experiences during class time at the beginning of the year. I will also explain how to install an APP to a hand held device and send or call parents to answer any questions they may have with this APP. I believe that my students, who are between the ages of 11 and 13, do not have their own hand held devices and the parents are still in control of the screen time they are allowed to have. Showing the parents what the mobile device APP and the lessons and experiences I have designed to use in the classroom could persuade them to allow their child to use a mobile device to enhance their education.
