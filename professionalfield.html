				<p><b> Description:</b> The purpose of the professional development I participated in was to help the teachers where I work, Ohio Virtual Academy (OHVA), become more proficient in using Excel to gather, store and anyalyze our data for the students we teach. The online school where I teach is 100% online. The students and teachers are from all over the state of Ohio. They use the internet to access their lesssons everyday. The students are required to log into live classess from thier home using Blackboard Collaborate as their conferencing software. The students have specific times for specific classes all during the day, just like a brick and mortar school. All lessons, lectures, interactive activites, classroom lectures, homework and discussions are all done online using current hardware and software that is provided to the student by OHVA. There are teams of teachers who are responsible for no more than 150 students for each team.</p>
				<p>Each teacher is responsible for gathering data, analyzing data, and using the data to make teaching decisions for each student. We are encouraged to use Excel to keep all our data organized and easily accessible. This professional development was designed to help us become more aware of the software's capabilities. Before the PD, we were sent an email with a sample Excel spreadsheet attached. We were expected to log into our Collaborate sesssion in the morning and have the spreadsheet already opened and ready to go. There was a short introduction and instructions on what we were expected to do and then we were given 90 minutes to complete the tasks. There were 12 tasks to complete. The tasks were set up in breakout rooms, one task per room, with a set of instructions an how to complete the task posted in each room. We needed to begin with what ever room we wanted and proceede throughout the other rooms within 90 minutes. There was an expert Excel user assigned to each room to stay and answer questions that arose during the session.When we completed the tasks, we were to move back to the main room for the closing remarks.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> The exercises we were to preform were set up to show us some of the ways we could organize and pull data from our entire spreadsheet. I found that the hands on approach of learning was very beneficial to me. I am a visual and hands on learner so this type of lesson helped me process and understand the different tools that were available within the Excel software. These tools  would help me streamline the anayzing of my data. One of the most helpful tools I found was the freeze payne tool. This will let you freeze the first comlumn or top row of your spreadsheet while scrolling to other data that you want to read. This helps you keep track of what student you are looking at and you can still read the headings for each column. This is very helpful when you have a very big spreadsheet.  </p> 
<p><b>Intent:</b> I benefited two ways from this professional development. The first way I benefited was by the knowledge that I gained during this professional development. The tools that were showcased in our tasks were tools that would help me  become more efficient for organizing my data and using the data for designing lessons. The second way I benefitted was by the way the professional develpment was set up in breakout rooms with me following a set of instructions and acutally doing the work myself. This helped me learn the keystrokes and the menues that the tools were located in. I have been become a better Excel user and become more creative with what I use Excel for. I will continue to use Excel to collect and analyze data to help me save time when analyzing my data.

                <p><strong><a href="https://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Artifact 2 Online learning through Lynda.com:</a></strong></p><p><b>Description:</b> This website has thousands of hours of courses online for me to grow and develop my technology skills. The possibilities are endless. You can become a member for $24.99 a month or if you are lucky enough to have an employer who pays for it, then you are set.</p> 
<p><b>Impact:</b> I have taken many courses through Lynda.com. I learned how to create simple animated .gifs to use in my classroom. The classes are hands on and very imformative. I have learned how to create my own GIFs. I have used these in the classroom to bring attention to some important information. I have learned how to create small apps using Java Script. These are used as quick activities for my students to do.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will continue to take these online classes to help me gather more skills in technology so that I can create my own supplemental learning materials that will help my students.
