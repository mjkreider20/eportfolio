				<img src="hiking.jpg" alt="hiking" width="284" height="146"/> <p><strong>Artifact 1 The Instructional Technology Master's Program:</strong> Description: The Instructional Technology Master’s program at the University of Akron was designed for teachers to learn more about how to design and deliver lessons using the rich technology resources that are available in the public school setting. These classes taught about the design process using the ADDIE method. (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate). I learned about the International Society for Techology in Education Standards for students, teachers, and administrators. Finally I was able to design lessons using the TPACK(Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Knowledge) theory and model for incorporating meaningful technology into my lessons.
Impact: This program has made me a better teacher. The decisions I make and the lessons I design using technology as a tool better than I did before taking these classes. I am more confident in my choices for using technology and what technological tools to use based on my students’ needs. 
Intent: I will continue to grow in my knowledge of new technology and use that knowledge in the classroom to prepare my students to be good learners and citizens in the 21st century. Teaching them to be creative, how to better communicate and collaborate will be my focus.

                <p><strong><a href="https://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Artifact 2 Online learning through Lynda.com:</a></strong> Description: This website has thousands of hours of courses online for me to grow and develop my technology skills. The possibilities are endless. You can become a member for $24.99 a month or if you are lucky enough to have an employer who pays for it, then you are set. 
Impact: I have taken many courses through Lynda.com. I learned how to create simple animated .gifs to use in my classroom. The classes are hands on and very imformative.
Intent: I will continue to take these online classes to help me gather more skills in technology so that I can create my own supplemental learning materials that will help my students.
