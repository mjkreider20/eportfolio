				<img src="campfire.jpg" alt="campfire" width="275" height="183"/><p><strong><a href="Unit 2 Lesson 9 Average rate of change (1).pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 1 Guided Notes</a> and <a href="Unit 2 Lesson 9- Rate of Change.pdf" target="_blank"> Pages from the SMART Notebook Presentation</a> </strong></p><p><b>Description:</b> This unit uses SMART Notebook and the SMART board to integrate technology into the pre-algebra class for 9th grade. The lessons in this unit was used with general education and special education students in an inclusion classroom. The lessons were designed to incorporate SMART Notebook technology the help motivate the students to be active participants in the learning process. One activity, “Whack a Mole”, is designed to get students out of their seats by having them throw a bean bag at the screen and a math problem will pop up for them to solve. These lessons were used in both a physical brick and mortar class and in a totally 100% online school. Both environments encouraged the students to be activie in thier learning.<p>The unit also has guided notes that were provided to the students using email and in printed form for the students fill in as the lesson is delivered.</p>  
<p><b>Impact:</b> The lessons in this unit help students who have different learning styles. The differentiation of lessons and activities help each student be successful. The students in the brick and mortar environment were more comfortable using the printed notes. They were more inclined to use the paper and pencil version to write more notes and copy all the examples. The students who were in the totally 100% online school were more comfortable using the elcectronic version of the notes and filling them in while the lesson was being deliviered. Only  3 students with special needs printed the notes out at home to use a physical pencil to fill in the notes. Both groups of students benefited from the online activities that I built into these lessons. The data that was gathered in both groups of students showed inproved test scores than the students who did not have these electronic resources. The data was discussed in the weekly TBT meeting and it was decided to continue using these resources for the next school year.  </p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> I have been using the guided notes in my 100% totally online classroom. I will continue to use guided notes and online activities to enhance student learning and participation. The students are more engaged when using extra activities that use gaming environments and are not part of their regular curriculum. These supplemental materials are easily edited to meet the needs of different learning styles and different levels of knowledge. Differentiated lessons are very important to the success of my special needs students. The activities that are included in this unit have been an inspiration to me to design interactive lessons for our totally online 7th grade math curriculum. Designing this unit helped me to design interactive units when I transitioned to an online environment.

				<p><strong><a href="Labsafetydifferentiated.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 2 Differentiated Science Assignment</a></strong></p><p><b>Description: </b>This artifact was designed to use in 7th grade science special needs students. These students are going to school using a 100% totally online environment. The science lessons are delivered using the internet. The students and teachers use Blackboard Collaborate as a conferencing software. The students log into thier science class to participate in science lessons and interact with the teacher and other students. My students were grouped in 3 different ability groups. Each group was given a different level of this assignment. The assignment was emailed to each student, depending on their ability. Each group needed to access the website that was provided to them. The website has an interactive game of finding the lab safety violations. There were videos to watch, a class discussion was involved after the video and then they were given the supplemental material to complete as a formative assessment. The high ability group was given the document to fill in as they navigated the website. Their exercise was more open ended for them to fill in the blanks, The middle group had to identify and match information. The low group had to go to the website and click on the gaming aspece that showed the different safety hazards in the lab. They identified them by clicking on the picture that showed the hazard.</p> 
<p><b>Impact:</b> Differentiating this assignment was very beneficial for my students. The different groups enjoyed the extra videos and articles that were presented for this assignment. The different ability group assignments were very successful and the students were able to understand the content of lab safety better because of the visual gaming aspect of the activity and the videos.  I was able to integrate a website for the students that was easy for them to navigate on their own and then bring them back to have a class discussion. The different levels of difficulty were spot on for the students. The electronic version of the formative assessment is easy to edit and adapt for future students, depending on their needs. </p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> I am constantly trying to find new interactive activities for the students in my 100% online classes. The students are more motivated to participate and they understand the science content better when using extra online resources. The beauty of teaching in a 100% online envirnment is that the lessons and assignments are easily differentiated for each level of student ability. Using extra resources that are online will continue to be my focus when working with my special needs students. I will focus on a variety of methods for students to show mastery for content.
