				<img src="campfire.jpg" alt="campfire" width="275" height="183"/><p><strong><a href="Unit 2 Lesson 9 Average rate of change (1).pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 1 Guided Notes</a> and <a href="Unit 2 Lesson 9- Rate of Change.pdf" target="_blank"> Pages from the SMART Notebook Presentation</a> </strong></p><p><b>Description:</b> This unit uses SMART Notebook and the SMART board to integrate technology into the pre-algebra class for 9th grade. There are activities like “Whack a Mole” where the students can throw a beanbag at the screen and a math problem will pop up for them to solve. The unit also has guided notes that the students fill in as the lesson is delivered.</p> 
<p><b>Impact:</b> The lessons in this unit help students who have different learning styles. The differentiation of lessons and activities help each student be successful. I try to design lessons that help all learning styles.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> I have been using the guided notes in my classroom now. They are very helpful when working with special needs students. The activities that are included in this unit have been an inspiration to me to design interactive lessons for our totally online 7th grade curriculum. Designing this unit helped me to design interactive units when I transitioned to an online environment.

				<p><strong><a href="Labsafetydifferentiated.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 2 Differentiated Science Assignment</a></strong></p><p><b>Description: </b>This artifact was designed to use in 7th grade science. My students were grouped in 3 different ability groups. Each group got a different assignment. The high group was given a worksheet to fill out the information. The middle group had to identify and match information. The low group had to go to the website and click on the different safety hazards in the lab.</p> 
<p><b>Impact:</b> Differentiating this assignment was very good for me. I was able to integrate a website for the students. The different levels of difficulty were spot on for the students I had at the time. I had to modify it the next year to make it fit my students for the next semester.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> I have learned how to differentiate lessons for different levels of ability. I will use technology more to help the students learn the content that is being presented. I believe that using different ways for the students to show mastery will be something I do in the future.
