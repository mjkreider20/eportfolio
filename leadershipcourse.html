				<img src="leadershipcourse.jpg" alt="Margaret's Picture" width="245" height="205"/><p><strong><a href="Kreider Case Study.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 1: Case Study, Technology Plan:</a></strong> Description: The task was to evaluate a technology plan as a case study. My job was to take an existing plan and make recommendations for the district to implement technology in the classroom. 
Impact: I found that there was a vision of using technology seamlessly in the district that I choose. They had set up committees and had regular meetings of the technology committee, but they did not follow through with some of the initiatives that they had set up. They also did not include any parent input or participation in planning for technology in the long term goals. This could be a detriment to the plan if you do not have parent involvement at home or in the planning stages.
Intent: This exercise showed me the many different things to consider when making decisions on how to use technology as a district initiative. I will take into account the needs of the students, parents and teachers, when making long term technology plans. Input from the community and district leaders will also be important since they need to approve any plans and support.

				<p><strong><a href="Kreider Grant Proprosal.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 2: Grant Writing:</a></strong> Description: Learn how to write a grant for education purposes. We were to write a grant for our classroom that included technology. 
Impact: Searching for a proper company to write my grant was time consuming. I had to research some different technology resources that could be used in the classroom. Then I had to match my idea with a company or organization that would fit the proposal. This took much time. 
Intent: Writing a grant took lots of time. I learned that there are many organizations that will give money to educational classrooms if it is a good fit for them. I have made a spreadsheet of resources and of project ideas that I can use in the future. I would like to design and implement more hands on activities for my students in the online school that I teach for.
