				<p><strong><a href="Introduction to IT Reflections.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 1 Wiki Reflection</a></strong></p> <p><b>Description:</b> For the class, Introduction to Instructional Technology, I had to reflect on 8 different prompts during the semester. They were posted on a Wikki and then other students in the class were able to comment on my thoughts.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> The impact on my learning was very enlightening. I was made to think about subjects that I had taken for granted or had never thought about before. The TPACK model of designing lessons for integrating technology was very helpful. I considered myself a content specialist for Math, so that is where I started when designing lessons.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will keep using the TPACK model to design lessons for the classroom. I will start with the content knowledge when designing lessons for math and the technology knowledge when designing lessons for language arts.

				<p><strong><a href="Kreider OLE Simplifying Linear Expressions.pdf" target="_blank"> Artifact 2-Simplfying Expressions Intervention:</a></strong></p> 
<p><b>Description:</b> I designed an online learning environment for special needs students in 7th grade. The 5 day unit is meant to supplement the Expressions and Equations unit in our 7th grade online curriculum. The formative assessment and the summative assessment are auto graded and the results are available for review electronically.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> Designing a totally online intervention was very helpful to my students. They were able to review and revisit this online intervention throughout the year to help them remember the concepts of combining like terms and simplifying expressions.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will keep using this project for future classes and students. I will also design other online interventions that are self-contained so that the students are able to review or practice their skills throughout the year.

				<p><strong><a href="Kreider Smalley Final Lesson Plan.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 3 Lesson Plan using MetaVerse APP:</a></strong></p>
<p><b>Description:</b> I worked with a partner to design a different piece of technology to integrate into my geometry unit for 7th grade special education students. We used an APP called Metaverse Studio to design augmented reality experiences for the students to use to practice finding surface area and volume of 3-dimentional shapes.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> These experiences were very easy and fun to design and make. The interface Metaverse uses is very intuitive and powerful. The students who did the experiences said they were fun and would rather do this type of activity instead of a worksheet with the same problems.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will model how to download and use the APP before assigning the experiences in the future. This should help the students feel more comfortable in using the App. I did give the students a pre-assessment survey asking them if they had access to a smartphone or tablet and if they were allowed to use the device for school. I designed a pencil and paper alternative assignment for students who were not able to use an electronic hand held device.
