                <p><strong><a href="Kreider Smalley Final Lesson Plan.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 1 MetaVerse APP Lesson Plan</a> and <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cqiYFXOuEW" target="_blank">Movie:</a></strong></p> <p> <b>Description:</b> I wanted to use new technology for my students to practice geometry concepts. I chose the Metaverse Augmented Reality APP for my students to download on a mobile device. I designed 10 Metaverse Experiences for the students to use. Each experience was designed as a short game to have them practice finding surface area or volume of a 3D shape. The students completed each experience to earn points toward their grade.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> The students who participated in using the Metaverse APP said that they like doing them better than having the same problems on a worksheet to turn in. I was very excited to have found a different way to measure mastery. There were several students who did not use the Metaverse APP because they did not own a mobile device and / or their parents did not want them to download the APP to a shared device. I designed an alternative activity for those students.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will continue using the Metaverse APP and Studio to design different AG experiences. But, I will take more time to model how they are to be experienced and give more information to the parents about what the APP is and how it will be beneficial to the learning experience. Hopefully, this will get the students excited enough and ease the minds of parent to have more participation using this tool.

                 <p><strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/zips.uakron.edu/packaged-deals/home" target="_blank">Artifact 2 Packaged Deals Assignment: </a></strong></p><p><b>Description:</b> The Packaged Deals assignment in our curriculum is a culminating activity for the end of the year. They are to find a bundle price package of their choice and price everything separately to see if the bundle is a better deal than buying everything separately. The math skills they use are: calculating tax, finding percent of change, finding percent of whole and basic operations. The writing skills they use are: making predictions, comparing and contrasting, insightfulness, and drawing conclusions. They put all their information on a PowerPoint presentation and present to the class.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> The packaged deal assignment is very involved and has many steps and possibilities. I modified it for my students who have special needs. They need to have the steps broken down and given a timeline to complete the smaller tasks that are involved to complete the assignment. I used Google Sites and Google Docs to create a webpage where all the information was presented. They were given a floorplan of a department store to click to find the prepackaged deal. All the information they needed was on the Google Doc. There were 12 packaged deals they could choose from.  I found that my students were very thankful for the timeline and checklist of steps for them to stay organized.</p>  
<p><b>Intent:</b> This redesigned packaged deal helped my students by keeping them on track and organized to complete the assignment and turn it in. I believe that I will take more time to walk them through how to access the website and where to find all the templates, timeline, and checklist so they are comfortable with using this resource. Also, I will create a Drop Box on my class home page for them to turn it in. Sending me the finished presentation to my email was confusing to them since they were used to submitting assignments into the LMS Drop Box.

                <p><strong><a href="http://finalpresentationkreidersmalley.pbworks.com/w/page/131586885/FrontPage" target="_blank">Artifact 3 Anamated Slides:</a></strong></p> <p><b>Description:</b> I worked together with another teacher to create this presentation. Then, I used the Google Slides Animation in the classroom. I designed a sequence that showed the students the impact of enlarging a shape by a scale factor. The visual representation helps them to understand the concept of scale factor. The video shows how creating animations can be used in other content areas.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> Many of my students are visual learners. I used the animation of enlarging a shape by a scale factor of 3 to show them the impact of how a scale factor affects a shape. The students seemed to understand what scale factor meant and how it changed the shape. We were able to talk about proportion, scale factor, enlarging and reducing.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> These animations were not very hard to make. They were, however, time consuming. But, it was still faster to create an animation to my studentâ€™s needs than to search the Internet for just the right one. I will keep designing these to help make abstract concepts more concrete for my students.
