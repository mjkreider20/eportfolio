                <p><strong><a href="Kreider Smalley Final Lesson Plan.pdf" target="_blank">Artifact 1 MetaVerse APP Lesson Plan</a> and <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cqiYFXOuEW" target="_blank">Movie:</a></strong></p> <p> <b>Description:</b>My special needs students are enrolled in a 100% online school. They have all of their curriculum delivered online using a secure website. The students are required to attend live sessions for all their classes and designated times during the day. The students and teachers use Blackboard Collaborate for their conferencing software. My students need a differentiated approach to learning geometry so I designed an alternative method of assessment using an Augmented Reality gaming like program. I wanted to use new technology for my students to practice geometry concepts. After researching different APPS that the students could use, I chose the Metaverse Augmented Reality APP for my students to download on a mobile device because it was available for free and for both IOS and Android devices. I had sent them the instructions in an email and posted the instructions on my home page for downloading the APP and how to access the experiences. I designed 10 Metaverse Experiences for the students to use. I posted the QR code on my home page for the students to access at their own pace. Each experience was designed as a short game to have them practice finding surface area or volume of a 3D shape. The students completed each experience to earn points toward their grade.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> I sent all of my students a post assessment asking for their opinion on the use of the Metaverse Experiences for learning the geometry content. I found that my students scored better and learned more when using the alternative assessment methods than the students who did not use the APP. The students who participated in using the Metaverse APP said in the post assessment  that they liked doing the Metaverse Experiences better than having the same problems on a worksheet to turn in. I was very excited to have found a different way to measure mastery. There were several students who did not use the Metaverse APP because they did not own a mobile device and / or their parents did not want them to download the APP to a shared device. I designed an alternative activity for those students.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> I will continue using the Metaverse APP and Studio to design different AG experiences. But, I will take more time to model how they are to be experienced and give more information to the parents about what the APP is and how it will be beneficial to the learning experience. Hopefully, this will get the students excited enough and ease the minds of parent to have more participation using this tool. I will introduce this APP at the beginning of the year and have the students watch as I model the APP as they watch online during our live sessions. I will design some small and easy exercises for math and Language Arts for the students to practice together before having them do these experiences on thier own for a grade.

                 <p><strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/zips.uakron.edu/packaged-deals/home" target="_blank">Artifact 2 Packaged Deals Assignment: </a></strong></p><p><b>Description:</b> The Packaged Deals assignment in our curriculum is a culminating activity for the end of the year. Students are to find a bundle price package of their choice and price everything separately to see if the bundle is a better deal than buying everything separately. The math skills they use are: calculating tax, finding percent of change, finding percent of whole and basic operations. The writing skills they use are: making predictions, comparing and contrasting, insightfulness, and drawing conclusions. They put all their information on a PowerPoint presentation and present to the class.The original activity is designed for the students to proceed at their own pace with only a list of tasks to complete written on a Word Document. I felt that this project needed updated and would be more fun if the students had the information in a more interactive form. My special needs students needed more step by step direction and instructions than the other students. I designed the Packaged Deal Website using Google Sites.  </p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> The packaged deal assignment is very involved and has many steps and possibilities. I modified it for my students who have special needs.The students were more motivated to start on thier assignment because they had all the information presented to them in a more interactive format. I used Google Sites and Google Docs to create a webpage where all the information was presented. They were given a floorplan of a department store to click to find the prepackaged deal. All the information they needed was on the Google Doc. There were 12 packaged deals they could choose from.  I found that my students were very thankful for the timeline and checklist of steps for them to stay organized. I had the students check in with me everyday to let me know thier progress. Some still needed some help and direction on how to access the website and the information. All 16 of my students completed the assignment on time and were given extra points for completing the pre-assessment. Some students were confused about where to turn in the completed assignment.</p>  
<p><b>Intent:</b> This redesigned packaged deal helped my students by keeping them on track and organized to complete the assignment and turn it in. I believe that I will take more time to walk them through how to access the website and where to find all the templates, timeline, and checklist so they are comfortable with using this resource. Also, I will create a Drop Box on my class home page for them to turn it in. Sending me the finished presentation to my email was confusing to them since they were used to submitting assignments into the LMS Drop Box. The LMS curriculum  drop box is very difficult to find for some students. The drop box is located within the last lesson of this assignment and it is not obvious as to what is expected to be turned in. This is a problem throughout our curriculum at Ohio Virtural Academy. There is not a consistent place to turn in the work that the students produce.

                <p><strong><a href="http://finalpresentationkreidersmalley.pbworks.com/w/page/131586885/FrontPage" target="_blank">Artifact 3 Anamated Slides:</a></strong></p> <p><b>Description:</b> I worked together with another teacher to create this presentation. My special needs students were confused about scale factor and how it connected to the proportion of an object. I designed an annimation using Google Slides to give them a visual of how the whole object changes in proportion to the original shap. I designed a sequence that showed the students the impact of enlarging a shape by a scale factor. The visual representation helps them to understand the concept of scale factor. The video shows how creating animations can be used in other content areas as well. I loaded the slides into our conferencing software to show to my students during our live session. The animated slides were easily stoped, paused and started again so that the students were able to discuss what they were seeing on the screen. This gave us time to do some calculations using the concepts we had learned.</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b> Many of my students are visual learners. I used the animation of enlarging a shape by a scale factor of 3 to show them the impact of how a scale factor affects a shape. The students seemed to understand what scale factor meant and how it changed the size of the shape without changing the shape. We were able to talk about proportion, scale factor, enlarging and reducing. The students wanted to see the annimation several times and stop it at different places to do calculations. This really helped them learn the concepts that were illustrated by using the animated slides. </p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> These animations are not very hard to make. They are, however, time consuming. But, it was still faster to create an animation to fill my studentâ€™s needs than to search the Internet for just the right one. I will keep designing these to help make abstract concepts more concrete for my students. Designing animated slides for other subjects will be something I will do in the future so that I can help my students who are visual learners grasp abstract concepts.
